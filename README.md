 <p>Fooding is meant to provide a user with a quick and easy way to manage and keep
track of groceries, their nutritional value, details about certain substances within them, as well as
availability and potential substitutes. The user must be registered in order to use the app; upon
account creation, aside from providing general info about themselves, they enter their health
details (some conditions they may have, for example diabetes) and their goals (maintenance,
weight loss, gainingâ€¦). The user can enter any groceries they have available, and the app gives
                   them potential easy-to-make recipes as well as the nutritional value for the meal </p>
